> a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL 

An application that allows users to add, remove and edit employees and their roles, salaries, departments and managers in a database. This project was built because companies often have multiple employees and storing all their information in a database with an application allowing easy edits, additions and removals could be helpful. The employeeTracker helps solve the problem of data storing and handling. In the duration of this project, I learned a lot about mysql and playing with the information within a database.
